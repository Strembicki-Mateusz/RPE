The programs presented are the result of my individual work 
and do not contain fragments or complete works of other 
programs that are not my own, except for explicitly cited 
published literature or examples presented in the lectures, 
which are clearly marked. 

I also declare that I have not commissioned third parties 
to perform any part or the entirety of this work.

I am fully aware that any violation of this declaration 
will result in consequences for me - both related to this 
course and in life, as such actions diminish my own skills 
and the habit of independent work. I am aware that this will 
negatively impact me, forcing me to exert much more effort, 
working longer and harder to make up for the lack of effort 
at this very moment.

By submitting plagiarized work, I undermine my own intelligence 
and violate the regulations in force at WrocLaw University of 
Science and Technology and the Republic of Poland.

I am aware that failure to comply with the content of this 
declaration may subject me to disciplinary action before the 
Rector of WrocLaw University of Science and Technology, 
the Disciplinary Committee for Students, or the Peer Court 
in accordance with the Higher Education Law, which specifies 
the disciplinary process. 

I know, according to the Act of February 4, 1994, on Copyright 
and Related Rights, that anyone who misappropriates authorship 
or misleads others regarding the authorship of all or part of 
someone else's work or artistic performance may be subject to 
a fine, restriction of liberty, or imprisonment for up to 3 years.

In addition to legal awareness, I acknowledge that plagiarism is 
one of the most dangerous pathologies in academic environments and 
represents a moral issue. The lack of respect for basic ethical 
and professional standards worsens the quality of education at 
universities and calls into question the value of higher education.

This makes studying less of an exceptional intellectual adventure 
and more of a "necessary" and unpleasant path to a "piece of paper."

I acknowledge that I have access to resources that will allow me to 
complete my work while learning skills that will be valuable later 
in life - such as independent, critical, and creative thinking when 
solving problems I will encounter as an engineer in my future life 
and career. This is more valuable than passing a single course more 
easily or with a better grade. It allows for thinking in a broader 
perspective and reinforces that studying serves personal development, 
not just passing.

I also understand that my course instructor derives great satisfaction 
from observing my genuine progress in skills and intellectual development, 
regardless of the level of my initial skills and knowledge.

I know that my independent work is essential for my personal growth 
and is crucial for the objective assessment of my skills and knowledge.
